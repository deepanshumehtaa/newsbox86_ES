## Project Goals 

- To create a web application which will allow users to share blog posts and news articles similar to reddit and other users will be able to up and down vote posts according to how important/newsworthy they think they are. Users will also be able to comment on posts and engage in a discussion. 

### User Goals
- To be able sign up and create an online profile to share blog posts/news articles.
- To be able to upvote and down vote posts according to importance.
- To be able to comment on a post and engage in a discussion.

### Site Owner Goals
- Create a django application that functions in a similar manner to that which can be found on reddit
- Create a django application which users will be able to follow intuitively.
- Create a django application which is fit for purpose and does not have any bugs.
- Create a django application which will have full CRUD functionality. 

## User Experience
### Target Audience
- People who follow the news.
- People who are interested in blogs.
- People who are interested in online forums.

### User Stories

#### First-time User 
1. As a first time user, I want to know what is expected of me on the home page.
2. As a first time user, I want to be able to sign up to the web site easily and create a profile. 
3. As a first time user, I want to be able to read posts but not be able to comment or post. 
4. As a first time user, I want to be able to add posts after I have signed up.
5. As a first time user, I want to be able to log out of the web site easily.
6. As the user, I want to be able to edit/update/delete a post.
7. As the user, I want to be able to engage in a discussion on a post.
8. As the user, I want to be able to see all posts from a particular category.

#### Site Owner
9. As the site-owner, I want to be able to review all posts, categories, users, upvotes, downvotes, etc.
10. As the site-owner, I want to be able to edit/update/delete a post. 
11. As the site-owner, I want to be able to direct users to my social profiles. 
12. As the site-owner, I want all areas of the site to function correctly and have no bugs. 

### Scope
In this first version a sign on using social profiles won't be implemented as well as password recovery. The user model would also be altered. In this first version, the down vote functionality also unfortunately was not implemented due to time constraints.

## Technical Design

### ERD of the database 

Below you can see the ERD, created with ![lucidchart](https://res.cloudinary.com/rashdogg74/image/upload/v1655558307/static/images/Database_ER_diagram_The_NewsBox_1_tvhfrs.jpg)

### UI/UX

Design inspiration came from (https://zyro.com/es/preview/bronx?utm_medium=affiliate&utm_source=aff1635&utm_campaign=aff35&transaction_id=1021ce1d83add930c49518a342eb22) as well as the I think therefor I blog walkthrough project on Code Institute and also reddit (https://www.reddit.com/) and also the journal (https://www.thejournal.ie/). Free hand diagrams/wireframes supplemented these.

### Data models

For this project I have used the following features:
- list comprehension making a list from an iteration, a more succinct way to create a list from a for loop. 
- If/else/elif statements
- Dictionaries e.g. in the username/password checking. 

## Technologies Used

### Languages

- [Python 3](https://www.python.org/)
- [Http](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP)
- [CSS](https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Overview.en.html)
- [Javascript](https://www.javascript.com/)

### Frameworks and Tools

1. [Heroku](https://heroku.com/) - Heroku was used to deploy the project and to provide a virtual terminal to for examiners. 
2. [GitHub](https://github.com/) - GitHub was used as a remote repository to store project code. 
3. [Gitpod](https://gitpod.com/) - Gitpod was used as the main IDE for this project.
4. [lucidchart.com](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/) - was used to draw flowchart and the ERD.
3. [Trello](https://trello.com/) - Trello was used as an agile took to manage the planning and implementation of all functionality.


#### Libraries

### 3rd Party Libraries
1. [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) - JUSTIFICATION:  For the purposes of the project spec, I wanted to host images uploaded by users to an external CDN. Cloudinary is an end-to-end image- and video-management solution for websites and mobile apps, covering everything from image and video uploads, storage, manipulations, optimizations to delivery.

2. [humanize](https://github.com/Humanizr/Humanizer) - JUSTIFICATION: For the purposes of the project spec, I wanted to give the user an easy human readable time format when viewing posts.

3. [crispyforms](https://django-crispy-forms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#) - JUSTIFICATION: For the purposes of the project spec, I wanted touse crispyforms to allow me to render django forms in an element manner and which interacts very well with bootstrap styling.

## Validation

### Python Validation
The Python code of each module was validated using [PEP8 Validation Service](http://pep8online.com/).  All modules returned a pass with 0 errors and few warnings due to django integration.

### HTML Validation
The html code of each file was validated using W3C Markup Validation Service .  Some files returned warnings but only due to djangos templates and variables. 

### CSS Validation
The W3C Jigsaw CSS Validation Service was used to validate the CSS of the website. It did not return any errors.


### Testing user stories

All user stories were extensively tested and the clear and simple interface, feedback messages as well as gaining insight from different people, testing it without any prior knowledge of the site, all helped in the deployment of this project. Coverage and Test Case were originally used also used for 50% of the application in it's past repository but due to time constraints I was not able to include it in this version.

## Bugs

| **Bug** | **Fix** |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Original plan was to use up and downvote functionality and subsequently order posts by that.| As my level of ajax is not up to a sufficient level I removed this funcitonality for this version of the project and added just an upvote button. |
| Footer was not sticking to the bottom of the page | Use 100% vh |
| Success messages not displaying  | Add javascript code at the bottom of base html page |
| Close to final deployment the database was comprimised because I tried to hard revert to an old commit, my tutors I and tried to debug, remove migrations etc but to no avail | Restart project in new repository and add everything again.. |
| I tried to include summernote in the html via an import but my tutor nor I could debug so that was removed and may be included in a later version | Due to time constraints this was not possible for this version of the product. |
| No redirect after creating a new profile | Added explicit redirect to settings after researching allauth documentation |
